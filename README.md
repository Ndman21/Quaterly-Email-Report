# Quaterly-Email-Report
A program used to send out a report based on quarterly data for a specific employee. This was made at the request of a former employer of mine during my time at the company. It pulls quarterly data from an excel spreadsheet and distibutes it to the employee it is relevant to. It sends the email through a gmail account to an outlook email. This project was great for familiarizing me with the interaction between Python and Excel, which I'm sure will show up frequently througout my time working with data.
